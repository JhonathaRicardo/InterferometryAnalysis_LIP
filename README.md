## Introduction
  In recent decades, the continuous development of compact particle accelerators based on wakefield laser acceleration (LWFA) has promoted contributions to fundamental and applied research [[1, 2]](#reference), including possible future use in proton therapy and hadron therapy [[3, 4]](#reference), and in the production of radioisotopes for nuclear medicine [[5, 6]](#reference). In this approach, ultrafast high-intensity laser pulses focused on a gas target to create a plasma wave with longitudinal electric fields able to accelerate electrons [[7, 8]](#reference). The advances in high-peak-power tabletop lasers in the last years and the high longitudinal electric fields (up to ∼1 TV/m) supported by plasma waves attracted attention to LWFA as a compact alternative for RF conventional accelerators [[9]](#reference).

Many groups around the world have sought advances in the field of LWFA and other plasma acceleration schemes from institutions in North America, Europe, and Asia [[2]](#reference). In Latin America, our research group pioneered the implementation of a laser-plasma accelerator at the Institute of Energy and Nuclear Research (IPEN) [[10]](#reference).Our main objective is to produce electron beams with energy up to tens of megaelectron volts per LWFA. By bremsstrahlung, Electron beams with those energies are able to produce $\gamma$ radiation to induce a $^{100} Mo(\gamma , n) ^{99} Mo$ photonuclear reaction as a future application [[11]](#reference). 

Currently, we are focusing efforts on several developments required for a LWFA installation, such as computational simulation support [[12–14]](#reference), a source of high-peak-power laser pulses [[15]](#reference), proper gaseous and plasma target creation [[16, 17]](#reference), and development and implementation of diagnostic tools to assist and monitor the experiments [[18, 19]](#reference). The development of diagnostic tools is very important for a better understanding of the laser-plasma interaction [[20]](#reference). Diagnostic efficiency is crucial, as instabilities in both targets and laser pulses can result in low reproducibility of LWFA processes and impair the quality of accelerated electron beams [[21]](#reference).
Among the various non-perturbing optical methods that can be used to diagnose the gaseous target [[22-25]](#reference), interferometry is a very accurate technique capable of quantifying very small optical path differences and therefore suitable for measuring density variations in LWFA targets [[26, 27]](#reference). 

The [Interferometry Analysis - LIP Profile] and [Interferometry Analysis - Gas-Jet Profile] were developed due to this need for a new diagnostic tool to aid in the characterization of the supersonic jet of gas, quickly and reliably. Both softwares were developed by our research group as part of the work to implementation of a laser-plasma accelerator at the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN).

## Installation
Interferometry Analysis - PIL software was developed in Python 3.11 and the use of this algorithm requires the installation of the following packages: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) [[28]](#reference), [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) [[29]](#reference) and [PyAbel](https://pyabel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) [[30]](#reference) for data processing, [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) [[31]](#reference) to manipulate interferogram images, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) [[32]](#reference) to plot results, and
[PySimpleGui](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) to create the users template.

The second way to use this software is through the executable file. The users can create a single .exe file using the [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) package trought the follow terminal command:

<code>   pyinstaller --onefile -w IntAnalysis_LIPProfile.py                </code>

## How to use it
Interferometry Analysis - LIP software has a graphical interface developed with PysimpleGUI. This interface assists users and facilitates their applications.
In this section, we provide users with a simple review of the software's functions and how to use them.
### Main Screen

|<img src = '/Images/MainScreen1.png'> |
|:--:| 
| *Fig.1 - Software Main Screen* |

### Interferogram Image
- ***[Interferogram (LIP)]*** Scaled LIP interferogram image.

- ***[Open File(s)]*** Open interferogram image(s) file(s) with the presence of gas jet. Image file extensions should preferably be .png or .snp. However, all image extensions (.gif, .jpg, .bmp, etc) could be used. The path to opened file is shown in text box above. If more than one file has been opened, each file will be analyzed individually and the average of all results will be presented to the user.
  > **Warning**   
  >  Interferometry Analysis - LIP software only works with grayscale image files. 

- ***[Interferogram (Ref.)]*** Scaled reference interferogram image.

- ***[Open File]*** Open an undisturbed interferogram image file. Image file extensions should preferably be .png or .snp. However, all image extensions (.gif, .jpg, .bmp, etc) could be used. The path to opened file is shown in text box above. Unlike interferogram gas jet files, the algorithm allows the insertion of only one reference file.
  > **Warning**   
  >  Interferometry Analysis - LIP software only works with grayscale image files. 
 
- ***[Rotate]*** The image rotates in degrees. Positive degrees promote counterclockwise rotation.  

- ***[Image Scale]*** The interferogram image shown is scaled to screen size (428,342) for users' viewing only. However, all processes to determine the gas jet density profile are done with the original dimensions of the image file.

- ***[Analyse Data]*** From this command button, the software will apply data processing to generate accumulated phase, inverse Abel transforms, and gas jet density profile.

- ***[Clear]*** This button clears software input datas.

### Options
- ***[Select Analysis Area]*** From the parameters in this form, the user can select the interferogram area to apply the algorithm to determine the gas-jet density profile. The selected area is defined by a rectangle with edges defined by X and Y coordinates (***[Y Coord]*** and ***[X Coord]***).
The user that intends to use the whole interferogram figure needs to uncheck the checkbox ***[Use select area]***.

- ***[Experimental Parameteres]*** In this form, the user set the experimental parameters used to obtain the interferogram image. These parameters are:
  - ***[Laser Wavelength]*** and ***[Laser bandwidth FHWM]*** in nm;

- ***[Analysis Parameters]*** This form contains the parameters for analysis of the interferogram images:
  - ***[Scaling Factor]*** of an interferogram image in pixels/micrometers;
  - ***[Sigma - Gaussian filter]*** is a width of gaussian image filter. The initial width depends on the image dimension, but can changed by the user. 
  - ***[Gaussian Filter Position]*** this parameter is different from Gaussian Blur. This parameter is set automatically by the algorithm and this position defines which frequency will be used to apply the Inverse Fourier Transform and build the phase map of the gas-jet.
Both the above parameters are defined in pixels. 
    > **Note** 
    > The algorithm set the frequency that defines a positive phase map.  But, users can change the filter position.
  - ***[Sigma - Gaussian Blur]*** is a multidimensional gaussian image filter. The standard deviation of the gaussian filter (Sigma) defined by the user is equal for all axes.
  
  - ***[Fringes Orientation]*** can be vertical or horizontal.
  - ***[Axisymmetric]*** An important parameter to apply the Inverse Abel Transform is the axis of symmetry (or axisymmetric). The axisymmetric can be horizontal or vertical.

### LIP Profile
- ***[Stages]:*** The stages of the results obtained by the algorithm can be viewed by user.
  - ***[Fourier Transform]*** This image is built through the Fourier Transform of gas-jet interferogram image. From this frequency map (*Fig. 2.A*), the software selects automatically the frequency that generates a positive phase map. The pixel position (red line) of the selected frequency is the ***[Gaussian Filter position]***.  
  > **Note**   
  >  Case the ***[Gaussian Filter position]*** is zero, the software will set the valor automatically.  The user can change this ***[Gaussian Filter position]*** manually.
  - ***[Gaussian Filter]*** This image is the Gaussian filter map applied to generate the phase map using the selected frequency (*Fig. 2.B*).

## How it works
The interferogram analysis software algorithm works according to the flowchart below:

|<img src = '/Images/Flowchart.png'>|
|:--:| 
| *Fig.  8 - Scheme for determining the LIP density profile from interferograms.* |

### Accumulated Phase
The Accumulated Phase map (or accumulated phase shift map) is obtained from the shifts of the speckle fields from two interferogram images. The first is the interferogram image with fringes disturbed due to the presence of gas and the second is a backgroung image (or reference) with undisturbed fringes. According to the flowchart, apply 2D Fourier transforms on both interferograms by transporting them in the frequency domain. Applying a Gaussian filter over the region containing the phase shift information [[33]](#reference) and inverting the Fourier transform over two frequency domain maps. Finally, we obtain the accumulated (or integrated) phase-shift map $\Delta\varphi_{z}$ [[33, 34]](#reference) along the beam propagation direction (z direction) by the following equation:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\varphi_{z} =  tan^{-1}\left({\varphi_{gas} - \phi_{ref}}\right)
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
$$

where  $\varphi_{gas}$  and  $\varphi_{ref}$   is, respectively, the gas-jet and background phase map.

#### Standard Deviation of Accumulated Phase

According to M. Lehmann [[35]](#reference), for two well-resolved speckle fields (background and perturbed by gas) the phase error is determined by the probability distributions of the intensities and phase derivatives of two speckle fields. Considering that each field has a Gaussian distribution of speckle intensities and since the measured phase is the difference between two speckle phases, its error also follows a Gaussian probability distribution, with standard deviation given by:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\Delta\varphi}(\Delta x, I_{0} ,I) = {\Delta x \over 2}{\pi \over \beta} \left\lbrack{ \overline{I} (I + I_{0}) \over 2 I I_{0}}\right\rbrack^{1/2}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}
$$

where $I$ and $I_{0}$ are the intensity distribution of both speckle fields (with mean intensity $\overline{I}$ each), $&Delta;x$ is the displacement of the image in the direction perpendicular to the direction axis of the fringes, and $\beta$ is the speckle size. 

|<img src = '/Images/Scheme_fringewidth_and_disp.png' width = '50%'>|
|:--:| 
| Fig.  9 - Scheme for determining the fringes widths (or speckles size) and images displacement   . 

### Inverse Abel Transform

As mentioned above, $\Delta\phi_{z}$ the integrated phase map along the laser beam propagation direction (z direction).
Assuming an axisymmetric gas-jet, the integrated information along $z$ is sufficient to reconstruct the radial information using inversion $\Delta\phi_{r}$ such as the Abel inversion method [[36]](#reference).

$$ \Delta\phi_{r} = - {1 \over \pi} \int_{r}^{\infty} {d (\Delta\phi_{z}) \over dz} {dz \over \sqrt {z² - r²}} \tag{3}$$ 

In this software, the phase map is determined from the application of the PyAbel [[30]](#reference) algorithm on the accumulated phase map.
PyAbel is a Python package that provides functions for the forward and inverse Abel transforms. The inverse Abel transform takes a 2D projection and reconstructs a slice of the cylindrically symmetric 3D distribution, which makes this function an important tool in analyzing the projections of angle-resolved, plasma plumes, flames, solar occultation [[30]](#reference), and gas-jets.

PyAbel provides efficient implementations of several Abel transform algorithms [[35]](#reference). In this software, the chosen method was the deconvolution algorithm Dash Onion Peeling because it is simple and computationally very efficient [[30]](#reference). According to Dash [[37]](#reference), this method requires less smoothing than other methods.

#### Standard Deviation of Inverse Abel Transform
The accuracy of applying the inverse Abel transform is associated with the standard deviation generated by a correlation between the normalized phase map curves $\left<\Delta\varphi_{r}\right>i$ and the mormalized accumulated phase map curves $\left<\Delta\varphi_{z}\right>i$.
These standard deviation $\left(\sigma_{Abel}\right)_{i}$ is obtained for each position $i$ on the symmetrical axis.

$$ \left(\sigma_{Abel}\right)_{i} = \sqrt{\left(\left<\Delta\varphi_{r}\right>_{i} - \left<\Delta\varphi_{z}\right>_{i}\right)^2} \tag{4}$$

This way, the standard deviation map $\sigma_{Abel}$ is build from each $\left(\sigma_{Abel}\right)_{i}$ as show following scheme:

|<img src = '/Images/Scheme_stdAbel.png' width = '50%'>|
|:--:| 
| *Fig.  10 - Scheme for determining the standard deviation of the phase map.* |

### Density Profile
From the $\Delta\varphi_{r}$ map, the 2D refractive index map for the plasma can be obtained by:

$$ n = 1 + {\Delta\varphi_{r} \lambda \over 2\pi} \tag{5}$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the laser inspecting the plasma. symmetry. Moreover, the plasma electronic density, $N_{e}$, can be evaluated from the
plasma refractive index ($5$) by [[38]](#reference):

$$ N_{e} = {4 \pi^2 c^2 \epsilon_{0} m_{e} \over e^2 \lambda^2} \left(1 - n^2\right) \tag{6}$$

where &c& is the speed of light in a vacuum, $m_{e}$ and $e$ are the electron mass and charge, and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity. This model assumes that there is no variation of $N_{e}$ across the plasma diameter due to differences in the local number of ionizations [[20]](#reference).

#### Standard Deviation of Density
The accuracy of the gas density measurement depends on the accuracies of the phase-shift measurement ($\sigma_{\Delta\varphi_{z}}$), and the numerical accuracy of the Abel inversion [[40]](#reference) ($\sigma_{Abel}$). This way, the standard deviation of phase-shift map $\sigma_{\Delta\varphi_{r}}$ can be write as ($5$):

$$  \sigma_{\Delta\varphi_{r}} = \sqrt{\left({\sigma_{\Delta\varphi_{z}}}^2 + {\sigma_{Abel}}^2\right)} \tag{5}$$

So, the standard deviation of gas density $\sigma_{\rho}$ is given by ($6$):

$$ 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rho} = \sqrt{\left({\partial\rho \over \partial\Delta\varphi_{r}}\right)^2 \left({\sigma_{\Delta\varphi_{r}}}\right)^2 + 
\left({\partial\rho \over \partial\lambda}\right)^2 \left({\sigma_{\lambda}}\right)^2}
\tag{6}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\sigma_{\lambda}$ is user-defined experimental parameter.
  > **Note**
  > The contribution of this parameter to the density standard deviation is usually very small.
